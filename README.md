Application of Neural Networks to classify the handwritten numerical digits
## What is an Artificial Neural Network
A neural network is an interconnected assembly of simple processing elements, units or nodes, whose functionality is loosely based on the animal neuron.
## Artificial Neuron
A neuron is the basic unit of an ANN. It is capable of processing information and a map of interlinked neurons forms a network.A schematic diagram of a neuron is given below.<br>

## Neural Network Models used here are 
### Single Layer Perceptron Based Model
### Multilayered Perceptron Model
## ACtivation Function
The activation function is used as a decision-making body at the output of a neuron. The neuron learns Linear or Non-linear decision boundaries based on the activation function. It also has a normalizing effect on the neuron output which prevents the output of neurons after several layers to become very large, due to the cascading effect.<br>
Some examples of activation functions are given below:<br>
•	Threshold Logic Unit function: outputs the value of either 1 or 0 depending upon the threshold.<br>

•	Sigmoid function: maps the input (x axis between value of 0 and 1<br>
