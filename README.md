Application of Neural Networks to classify the handwritten numerical digits
## What is an Artificial Neural Network
A neural network is an interconnected assembly of simple processing elements, units or nodes, whose functionality is loosely based on the animal neuron.
## Artificial Neuron
A neuron is the basic unit of an ANN. It is capable of processing information and a map of interlinked neurons forms a network.A schematic diagram of a neuron is given below.
